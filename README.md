Data Scientist Technical Assessment (Final)

Author: Paul Martinez
Environment: Python 3.13.x (IDLE, Windows)
Date: 2025-09-05

Purpose:
    This script fulfills the final assessment requirement to produce, via a single SQL query,
    a one-record-per-person dataset from the SQLite database built by `create_db.py`.
    The single SELECT query (no CREATE/INSERT, no temporary tables) may use subqueries and/or CTEs.
    The query:
      - Indicates census-level enrollment and persistence (per definitions in this script)
      - Computes a race/ethnicity column
      - Includes relevant curricular elements and program information
      - Computes GPA for each record
      - Includes minimum and maximum numerical grades for each record
      - Retrieves the most recent admission rating (by highest sequence); if none, imputes 'unk'
      - Includes any other clearly relevant data elements

Notes:
    - Dependencies: sqlite3, pandas
    - Input: SQLite database generated by `create_db.py` (paths handled in this script)
    - Output: pandas DataFrame containing the single-query result (optionally saved to file)
    - The script:
        1) Connects to the database
        2) Defines the single SQL query (as a string)
        3) Executes the query and returns the result as a pandas DataFrame
